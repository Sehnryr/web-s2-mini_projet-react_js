This is our second semester school project in which we have to present a Javascript library. We will be presenting ReactJS, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

It's quite an overengineered project because we could just have done a PowerPoint. But we thought it was better to practice the library by creating a website made with that same library and its environment to present the said library !

## Installation

You can install `nodejs` from [`nodesource`](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions), preferably LTS v14.x.

Use `yarn` for the package manager (Because otherwise there will be a conflict with the different lockfiles).

Clone the project locally _(change <your local directory> to whatever name you want for your directory)_:

```
git clone git@github.com:sehnryr/web-s2-mini_projet-react_js.git <your local directory>
cd <your local directory>
```

## Getting Started

To setup the developpment environment :

```
yarn install / yarn start
```

To start the developpment environment :

```
yarn start
```

<br />

To build the website (from the main branch) :

```
yarn deploy
```

This will push the build to the `gh-pages` branch and then, seconds after, Github Pages will update and the new build will be available on [melois.dev/react](https://melois.dev/react)

## Versioning

We're using [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning.
